      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Tangentyere Council is the major service delivery agency for the 18 Housing Associations known as ‘town camps’ in Alice Springs. Tangentyere Council began operating in the early 1970s and was first incorporated in 1979. Tangentyere Council was established
        to assist Aboriginal people to gain some form of legal tenure of the land they were living on in order to obtain essential services and housing.

          <h3>Mr W. Rubuntja</h3>
          <p>Late Mr W. Rubuntja (Mid 1920’s- July 2005) Mr W. Rubuntja was born around the mid 1920’s at Burt Creek to the north of Alice Springs where he spent his early years. Mr W. Rubuntja Pengarte was one of the leading founders of Tangentyere Council
            and instrumental in gaining tenure and rights for the town camp residents. Mr W. Rubuntja led the struggle for land rights, reconciliation and the protection of sacred sites, and had a leading role in the establishment of other Aborginal organisations
            in Central Australia including the Central Land Council, Yipirinya School and the Central Australian Aborginal Congress. In the early 1970’s Mr Rubuntja fought specially hard for the rights of his fellow town campers and saw a need of an Aborginal
            controlled council to provide basic services, such as shelter, food and clothing. Mr Rubuntja’s contribution to national public life was outstanding and he was made a member of the order of Australia in 1995.</p>

          <h3> E Rubunjta </h3>
          <p> E. Rubuntja Born on the 14th of March 1922 in Hermannsberg (Ntaria), E Rubuntja was strongly influenced by the early Lutheran Missionaries who ministered in the area. From early years, E Rubuntja was sent to school to learn to read and write
            without losing the significance of his bilingual upbringing, he spoke all of the Arandic languages (9), as well as Pintupi, Warlpiri and Pitjantjatjarra. He also read and wrote several languages, a skill he learned during his early bilingual
            education. Mr. Rubuntja was the very essence of compassion, determination, and vision. He was a popular man of our community and a great Indigenous leader, a Senior Arrernte Lawman and a Pastor of the Lutheran Church. He was a wise and highly
            respected elder of 84 years and is regarded as the founding father of Tangentyere Council, Yipirinya School, and was instrumentally involved in the establishment of Aboriginal organisations such as Central Land Council, Central Australian
            Aboriginal Legal Aid Service, Central Australian Aboriginal Congress, Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association and was involved in establishing the Institute from Aboriginal Development as an Aboriginal organisation.</p>
