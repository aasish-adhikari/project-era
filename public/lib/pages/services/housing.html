      <h2>Central Australian Affortable Housing Company </h2>
      <p>
        The Central Australian Affordable Housing Company (CAAHC) is the successor to the Tangentyere Housing Department and has been operational since January 2011 when the NT Government and Tangentyere Council agreed to novate the service level agreement (SLA) for the delivery of property and tenancy management services on the Alice Springs Town Camps. The Tangentyere Housing Department ceased to operate as a consequence of this transfer of work to CAAHC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tangentyere is the Founding Member of CAAHC. CAAHC was established by Tangentyere Council in response to the changes in land tenure and housing management on the Alice Springs Town Camps since the signing of 40 year subleases between the Housing Associations and the Executive Director of Township (EDTL) in December 2009. The impact of the signing of the subleases between the Housing Associations and the EDTL and the subsequent agreement between the EDTL and the NT Government establishing the Department of Housing as the Housing Authority for the Town Camps on the Housing Associations has been significant. Impacts have included the loss of control over housing allocations, reduced capacity for community decision making processes, the loss of rental income and a reduction in the security of tenure of many residents (many legacy Town Camp households have been shifted from fixed term tenancies to periodical tenancies by the Department of Housing due to minor repairs & maintenance issues and rental arrears). Significantly the Housing Associations have lost control over Town Camp land that was gained in a struggle for self determination during the 1970s and 1980s. Town Camp land is viewed as a legacy to be passed on to future generations rather than a speculative commodity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tangentyere Council developed a constitution that aims to provide the Tangentyere Executive Committee with the confidence that CAAHC will continue to protect the interests of the Town Campers. The desire to protect the rights of Town Campers does not seek to restrict the business of CAAHC to the Alice Springs Town Camps. There is a long history of Tangentyere Divisions and Social Enterprises being engaged in the delivery of services throughout Central Australia and Tangentyere supports CAAHC to have a similar portfolio of regional work.
      </p>
      <p>
        CAAHC is a not for profit Company Limited by Guarantee. CAAHC has four member organisations which are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Tangentyere Council (Founding Member)</li>
          <li>Healthabitat</li>
          <li>MLCS Corporation</li>
          <li>Central Land Council</li>
