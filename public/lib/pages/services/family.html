        <h3> Background </h3>
        <section>
          <p>
            The Safe Families Program is a unique model which developed following consultations and workshops with local Indigenous leaders, community groups and service providers. This process was based on a need to enhance outcomes for young Indigenous people,
            as well as supporting families to improve their capacity to provide care.

            </p>
            <li> Families Safe Houses </li>

              together in safe, stable and independent accommodation.
