                A history of the town camps in Alice Springs and the formation of Tangentyere Council can be found under
                Historical Overview. Please take the time to enjoy navigating our site and finding out about the many
                programs and services that Tangentyere provides in our effort to improve the living conditions and
                opportunities of Aboriginal people, particularly those living in town camps.

            <p>
                Tangentyere Council is proud of its achievements since its incorporation in 1979. We also recognise that
                there is still much to be done by us, by government and by all those who have a part to play in meeting
                the substantial challenges involved in addressing Aboriginal needs and disadvantage.
